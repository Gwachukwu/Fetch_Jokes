A man was caught stealing in a supermarket today while balanced on the shoulders of a couple of vampires. He was charged with shoplifting on two counts. 
Why did the man run around his bed? Because he was trying to catch up on his sleep!
Today a man knocked on my door and asked for a small donation towards the local swimming pool. I gave him a glass of water.
